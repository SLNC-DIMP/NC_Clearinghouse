# NC_Clearinghouse
<h2>MARC files for digital state publications.</h2>

To provide title-level access for digital publications of the State of North Carolina. All digital publication metadata will follow RDA and P-N/RDA e-resource standards https://www.loc.gov/aba/pcc/scs/documents/PN-RDA-Combined.pdf. 

<b>All links:</b>
<br>
856 <i>$3 NC Digital</i> will identify NC_Clearinghouse URLs.<br>
Other URLs (HathiTrust, Internet Archive, etc) will be removed.

<b>Serial and multipart item links:</b>
<br>
For title-level access for serials and multivolume series, title-level links will be exported from NC Cardinal. 

<b>Monograph links:</b>
<br>
Links for monographs will be exported from Quartex in "long link" format. Long links provide more information for those managing batch metadata. They are ridiculously long but may be masked at discretion of local cataloging policies.

<b>Links on print-coded records</b>
<br>
The project will first focus on born-digital and more recent digitized titles that meet P-N/RDA standards. Treatment and dissemination of hybrid records (where URL is piggy-backed on print-coded MARC records) is TBD. <br>
Potentially will just create "brief" e-resource record by removing format coding (fixed, 006, 007, 33X, 34X fields) and identifying OCLC data (010, 035 fields). A note will indicate "brief" records. TBD.
